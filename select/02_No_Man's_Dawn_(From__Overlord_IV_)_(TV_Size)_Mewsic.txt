The flower was blooming, my outlook was shining but
The sun is shaded and they all vanished in the dark
And all of my dreams lied to me and left me behind, so naive
Alone by myself in the dawn with nothing left to carry on

(I don't need anything)
If only they come back

My everything, my everything that I have loved
Where's everything? Just let me hear your answer, please now
Oh even if every tear that I have cried is dried and gone
The world that I once loved is gone and nowhere to be found
